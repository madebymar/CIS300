         <h3>"Site Analysis"</h3>
         <h4> This is an architectural board compromising in-depth site analyis done for a proposed housing project located in downtown Phoenix, near the Van Buren. The board consists of compelling graphics that present intricate data about the site and its surrounding areas. This included demographics, historical development and analysis of the area, context around the proposed site and nearby buildings, and even sun path diagrams to demonstrate how light affects the site over the year. 
                It also provides several different collaged views from looking towards and from the site, allowing the viewer to get a deeper understanding for the location and what it currently looks like.
              <br> 
              <br>
              This board is the crucial beginning of the story for the presentation of the proposed housing project, which went on to be nominated for Design Excellence at ASU.

         <h3>"Precedent & Possibility"</h3>
         <h4> This project aimed to create an extension to an exisiting cemetery in downtown Phoenix, in memorial of those who traveled long and hard to settle in Arizona, and created the town that we know and love today. 
             Dedicated to the pioneers of Arizona, this design is inspired by the jagged, non-linear, difficult journeys that they took from the East in order to get to the valley. This north to east circulation is carefully choregraphed into a special memorial walk, constructed by two large corten steel walls that 
             dance through the site, guiding visitors through a special journey reminiscing that of the pioneers. Through this walk, people will experience moments of people's names on the walls, and water walls, creating a peaceful auditory atmosphere and also cooling off the walk during the hot summer months. 
             There is also a reflection space that people may choose to enter or pass by, featuring an intricate opening of windows to create a piece of art with light on the surrounding walls. The path then leads to the main building program, made by rammed earth, signifying the end of the journey, and the lasting permanence that the pioneers were able to make of this state we call Arizona.
